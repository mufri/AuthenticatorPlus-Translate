Authenticator Plus Localization
===============================

Thanks for your interest in helping me to localize [Authenticator Plus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mufri.authenticatorplus)

## Translating Instructions

 1. Download/clone this repository to your local machine.

 2. The `string`s that need translated are contained within three files in the `values/` directory:
     * <b>`strings.xml`</b> contains the application `string`s that will need to be translated.
     * <b>`strings_wear.xml`</b> contains the Android Wear applicatino `string`s that will need to be translated.
     * <b>`short_description.txt`</b> contains the "short description" promo message
      that will be displayed in the Play Store (note that the Play Store enforces an *80 character limit*).
     * <b>`full_description.txt`</b> contains the "full description" message
      that will be displayed in the Play Store (note that the Play Store enforces a *4000 character limit*).
 3. Translated `string`s should go in the `values-XXX/strings.xml`, `values-XXX/short_description.txt`,
    and `values-XXX/full_description.txt` files, where `XXX` is your language's
    [locale code](http://www.science.co.il/Language/Locale-codes.asp).

 4. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Remember to double check your translation for typos, copy/paste
     errors, etc. when you finish just to be safe (and if you think you've spotted
     an accidental typo/bug, feel free to let me know so we can fix it!). :)

 5. The easiest way to submit your translation is by
    [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
    Feel free to send me the translated files directly via
    [email](mufri@authenticatorplus.com) as well... whichever option is easiest
    for you. :)

 6. When the translation is published, I'll add your name to the About activity... it's my way of saying thanks! :)
